# Energy Dashboard

The **Energy Dashboard** is a platform that optimizes energy consumption for households and businesses with solar panels based on time-of-use (TOU) or time-of-day (TOD) electricity tariffs. The goal is to help users maximize savings by shifting energy usage to periods when electricity is cheaper and using stored solar energy during peak pricing times.

## Features

1. **Real-Time Tariff Monitoring**:
   - Fetch and display real-time rates for off-peak, mid-peak, and peak electricity tariffs.
   - Display upcoming tariff rates in a user-friendly interface.

2. **Energy Consumption Analytics**:
   - Monitor and analyze energy consumption patterns.
   - Provide detailed reports on energy usage and potential cost savings.

3. **Smart Scheduling**:
   - Schedule high-energy appliances (e.g., washing machines, EV chargers) to run during low-tariff periods.
   - Integrate with smart home devices for automated control.

4. **Solar Energy Management**:
   - Track solar energy production and usage in real-time.
   - Manage battery storage to use stored solar energy during peak tariff periods.

5. **Forecasting and Recommendations**:
   - Predict future energy consumption and solar production using machine learning.
   - Provide personalized recommendations based on forecasted tariffs and weather conditions.

6. **User Notifications and Alerts**:
   - Notify users of upcoming high-tariff periods and suggest cost-saving actions.
   - Alert users when there's an opportunity to sell excess solar energy back to the grid.

7. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**:
   - Calculate potential savings from shifting energy usage and using solar energy during peak tariff periods.
   - Display historical savings and performance metrics.
